# Ruby

[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) is an open-source programming language with a strong developer focus. Created in 1996 by Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby became really popular in the late 2000s with the introduction of the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) web framework. While Ruby is used quite frequently for web development, it’s also popular as a scripting language.
