## What is Plasmic?

Plasmic is a visual builder for the web. This means that Non-developer like marketers or designers are able to build pages or part of pages per drag and drop and developers can integrate these into a website or app codebase.[^1]

> [!quote] The Goal of Plasmic[^2]
> The goal is to empower and unblock non-developers such as marketers and designers, while freeing up developers from pixel-pushing. Teams can thus move faster, iterate more, and ship higher quality products.

## Features

- Visual [[page builder]] that can drag and drop your code components—this is the “heart” of Plasmic.
